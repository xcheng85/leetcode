/* Obviously, Prob(the 3rd char is picked) = 1/3;
Prob(the 2nd char is picked) = 1 * 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3;
Prob(the 1st char is picked) = 1 * 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3;

So we can say that when we now has n chars and there is still another char in the file, we can pick the other char with prob= 1/(n+1), also keep original char with prob = n/(n+1), 
then we can secure each char is picked with same prob = 1/(n+1), because prob = 1 * 1/2 * 2/3 * 路路路路 * n/(n+1) = 1/(n+1).
